# SurvivalRF

Random Forest implementation for Survival Analysis

* This repo has currently the code submitted towards the final project of STAT 689 course, Spring 2018
* We didn't actually do the complete implementation of our proposed features in project proposal
* Rather we have written minimum-working-examples or basic skeletons of the trees which can be upscaled

### Description of folders and files

* `/notebooks`- Jupyter Notebooks in Python with our skeleton implementations
* `/datasets` - Datasets (`.csv`) files for the examples in notebooks
* `/docs` and `/site` are the folders for MKdocs, i.e. for package documentation. Nothing to evaluate there now from the project perspective.

You can go to here to [documentation](https://nayanchaudhary.github.io/SurvivalRF/)
to see what we had started with as a scaffold for the documentation of our package.
This can/will be used later when we finish the package.
